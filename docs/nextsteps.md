# Next Steps for the Project

## Add Authentication and Authorization
- Implement JWT-based authentication to secure your APIs.
- Use Spring Security to restrict access based on user roles (e.g., admin, user).

## Add Validation
- Use Bean Validation annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Email`, and `@Size` to validate incoming data.
- Handle validation errors gracefully with a global exception handler.

## Implement Pagination and Sorting
- Add pagination and sorting support to your repositories and REST endpoints.
- Use Spring Data's `Pageable` and `Sort` features.

## Expand Test Coverage
- Write unit tests for services and repositories.
- Add integration tests for REST APIs using `MockMvc` or `TestRestTemplate`.

## Generate API Documentation
- Use Springdoc OpenAPI to generate Swagger documentation for your APIs.
- Host the documentation at `/swagger-ui.html`.

## Set Up Docker Compose for Testing
- Create a separate `docker-compose.test.yaml` file for spinning up a test database.
- Use it to run integration tests in an isolated environment.

## Automate with CI/CD
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI.
- Automate building, testing, and deploying your application.

## Build a Frontend
- Create a simple frontend using React, Angular, or Vue.js.
- Integrate it with your REST APIs to display and manage data.

## Add Metrics and Monitoring
- Use Spring Boot Actuator to expose application metrics and health checks.
- Integrate with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

## Enhance Database Features
- Add stored procedures or triggers for complex operations.
- Use Flyway or Liquibase for database migrations.

## Implement Caching
- Use Spring Cache with Redis to cache frequently accessed data.
- Optimize performance for read-heavy endpoints.

## Add File Upload/Download
- Create endpoints for uploading and downloading files.
- Store files locally or in cloud storage like AWS S3.

## Support Internationalization (i18n)
- Add support for multiple languages in error messages and UI content.
- Use Spring's `MessageSource` for managing translations.

## Enable Real-Time Updates
- Use WebSockets to provide real-time updates (e.g., live order status).

## Deploy to the Cloud
- Deploy your application to AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
- Use Kubernetes for container orchestration and scaling.
